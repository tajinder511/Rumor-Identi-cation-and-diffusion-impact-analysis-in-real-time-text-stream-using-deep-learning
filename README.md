Rumor 路 clustering 路 COVID-19 vaccination 路 network analysis 路 diffusion
Researchers have applied marvelous endeavors in developing and
designing methodologies to understand the behavior of social media. Twitter
has allegedly been used as a platform of rumor promotions with momentous
political, economic, personal, and social outcomes in numerous countries. Similarly
in the process of COVID-19 vaccination, a lot may rumor are posted by
various users on different social media platforms. We designed rumor detection
and analysis methodologies, where our research work offers valuable insights
into how social media users influence the underlying network connecting different
users to gain a large reach in the spread of a rumor. We proposed a
rumor detection framework in continuous and discrete-time via deep learning.
The time required for a particular post to be diffused on social media is
also analyzed in the continuous and discrete case. Experiments conducted on
real-world data set reveal the effcacy of the proposed approach. Theoretically,
we give an effective way of data analytics for social media text mining and
diffusion analysis mainly rumor detection. Practically, our proposed approach
will play a significant role to improve the eminence of the rumor detection
mechanism for social media platforms. A real-time case study is evidence of
the effciency of our proposed approach.
