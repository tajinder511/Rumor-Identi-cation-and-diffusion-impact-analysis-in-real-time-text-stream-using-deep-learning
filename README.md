Researchers have applied marvelous endeavors in developing and
designing methodologies to understand the behavior of social media. Twitter
has allegedly been used as a platform of rumor promotions with momentous
political, economic, personal, and social outcomes in numerous countries. Similarly
in the process of COVID-19 vaccination, a lot may rumor are posted by
various users on dierent social media platforms. We designed rumor detection
and analysis methodologies, where our research work oers valuable insights
into how social media users inuence the underlying network connecting different
users to gain a large reach in the spread of a rumor. We proposed a
rumor detection framework in continuous and discrete-time via deep learning.
The time required for a particular post to be diused on social media is
also analyzed in the continuous and discrete case. Experiments conducted on
real-world data set reveal the ecacy of the proposed approach. Theoretically,
we give an eective way of data analytics for social media text mining and
diusion analysis mainly rumor detection. Practically, our proposed approach
will play a signicant role to improve the eminence of the rumor detection
mechanism for social media platforms. A real-time case study is evidence of
the eciency of our proposed approach.
